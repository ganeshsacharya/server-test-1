### APP TEAM SERVER RESOURCE: TEST#1

##### Create a REST API Backend for a frontend that is in need of the below features:

FYI: Frontend is out of scope for you.

1. The frontend has a DROPDOWN which needs to list DOG BREEDS
2. The frontend also has another DROPDOWN which will only be populated with SUB-BREEDS if the BREED selected in the First Dropdown has 1 or many SUB-BREEDS
3. The frontend has a page with IMAGES of Dogs which is derived from the selection done in the above 2 DROPDOWNS
4. The Page with the images can only show 5 items at a time. Meaning in Frontend there is a PAGINATION system which delivers 1 page at a time (meaning 5 images at a time). Which inturn means backedn should support PAGINATION on its API

SERVER SHOULD MAKE USE OF https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ for all the data that is needed to execute the above tasks.

Along with supporting the above functional requirements below needs to be followed too:

1. The backend needs to expose appropriate API's so that the frontend can show the UI
2. The backend should also have a CONSISTENT structure for the API Request and Response body.
3. All APIs must have a consistent response structure on both SUCCESS or ERROR responses
4. Backend coding should follow a consistent, clean coding structure
5. Every variable or function should have proper Naming Conventions
6. Erors must always be caught with Custom Error Messages
7. Correct HTTP response codes should be used
8. Most importantly what means will you use to communicate the APIs you built is the key takeway here!

##### You will get 4 hours for this task. Before 2PM you should push the code and continue with your other course tasks
